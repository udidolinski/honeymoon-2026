/**
 * Per-device persistence for the kid's mute preference. The toggle
 * in the Quiz card writes here; the orchestrator reads on every
 * mount and on every voice / SFX call.
 *
 * Default is `false` (audio on) — the quiz is voice-led; muting it
 * silently flattens the fun. We store the choice anyway so a parent
 * who muted it during a hospital waiting-room session doesn't have
 * to re-mute every time the kid opens it.
